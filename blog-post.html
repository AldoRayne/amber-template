                    <p>No health care? The market will fix it. I have come here to seek a new beginning between the
                        United States and Muslims around the world; one based upon mutual interest and mutual respect;
                        and one based upon the truth that America and Islam are not exclusive, and need not be in
                        competition. On economic development, we will create a new corps of business volunteers to
                        partner with counterparts in Muslim-majority countries. </p>
